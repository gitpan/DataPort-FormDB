1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Indentification

    This release is a collection of Perl modules that extend the
    capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. The system does
    not have any hardware. The Perl programming language contains two
    features that are utilized by this release:

    1   Program Modules to extend the languages

    2   Plain Old Documentation (POD) that may be embedded in the language

    These features are established by the referenced documents.

    DataPort accesses different types of data sources in different formats
    and streams them to a stanadard pure Perl API.

    The feature data source is the text base FormDB. The FormDB data source
    has improve flexiability and performance over other text base formats
    such as the Comma Separated Variable (CSV) format.

    The DataPort::FileType::FormDB module is an integral part of the US DOD
    SDT2167A bundle of modules. The data used by Test::STDmaker and
    ExtUtils::SVDmaker are stored in this format.

    The dependency of the program modules in the US DOD STD2167A bundle is
    as follows:

     Test::TestUtil
         Test::Tester
            DataPort::FormDB
                Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker

  1.3 Document overview.

    This document releases DataPort::FormDB version 0.03 providing
    description of the inventory, installation instructions and other
    information necessary to utilize and track this release.
