1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Indentification

    This release is a collection of Perl modules that extend the
    capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. The system does
    not have any hardware. The Perl programming language contains two
    features that are utilized by this release:

    1   Program Modules to extend the languages

    2   Plain Old Documentation (POD) that may be embedded in the language

    These features are established by the referenced documents.

    DataPort accesses different types of data sources in different formats
    and streams them to a stanadard pure Perl API.

    The feature data source is the text base FormDB. The FormDB data source
    has improve flexiability and performance over other text base formats
    such as the Comma Separated Variable (CSV) format.

    The DataPort::FileType::FormDB module is an integral part of the US DOD
    SDT2167A bundle of modules. The data used by Test::STDmaker and
    ExtUtils::SVDmaker are stored in this format.

    The dependency of the program modules in the US DOD STD2167A bundle is
    as follows:

     Test::TestUtil
         Test::Tester
            DataPort::FormDB
                Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker

  1.3 Document overview.

    This document releases DataPort::FormDB version 0.02 providing
    description of the inventory, installation instructions and other
    information necessary to utilize and track this release.

  3.3 Changes

    Hello, Samson Monaco Tutankhamen! Thanks for uploading your works to
    CPAN.

    I noticed that the test suite seem to fail without these modules:

    STD::Tester

    As such, adding the prerequisite module(s) to 'PREREQ_PM' in your
    Makefile.PL should solve this problem. For example:

     WriteMakefile(
        AUTHOR      => 'Samson Monaco Tutankhamen (support@SoftwareDiamonds.com)',
        ... # other information
        PREREQ_PM   => {
            'STD::Tester'   => '0', # or a minimum workable version
        }
     );

    If you are interested in making a more flexible Makefile.PL that can
    probe for missing dependencies and install them, ExtUtils::AutoInstall
    at <http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=ExtUtils-AutoInstall> may be
    worth a look.

    Thanks! :-)

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    CORRECTIVE ACTION:

    The Makefile.PL is automatically generated by ExtUtils::SVDmaker from
    the data stored in the DataPort::FileType::FormDB format in the
    Docs::Site_SVD::DataPort-FormDB module. For now, in
    Docs::Site_SVD::DataPort-FormDB

    Changed

     PREREQ_PM: ^

    to

     PREREQ_PM:
     'Test::TestUtil' => 0,
     'Test::Tester' => 0,
     ^

    and regenerated the distribution using ExtUtils::SVDmaker

    Uploaded Test::TestUtil and Test::Tester to CPAN in order to resolve the
    prerequiste.

    For a future project, should follow up on Mr. Smokehouse's
    recommendation and investigate ExtUtils-AutoInstall. Hopefully
    ExtUtils::SVDmaker can be extended by using ExtUtils::AutoInstall
    intact. Using the work of others can result in instant feature creep.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. Installation sites running Microsoft
    Operating systems require the installation of Unix utilities. An
    excellent, highly recommended Unix utilities for Microsoft operating
    systems is unxutils by Karl M. Syring. A copy is available at the
    following web sites:

     http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
     http://packages.SoftwareDiamnds.com

    There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of
    configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
    installation particular to any installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.

    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.

  3.6 Installation instructions.

    To installed the release file, use the CPAN module in the Perl release
    or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web site:

     http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

    Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

    The distribution file is at the following respositories:

       http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/DataPort-FormDB-0.02
       http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/DataPort-FormDB-0.02

  3.6.1 Installation support.

    If there are installation problems or questions with the installation
    contact

     603 882-0846 E<lt>support@SoftwareDiamonds.comE<gt>

  3.6.2 Installation Tests.

    Most Perl installation software will run the following test script(s) as
    part of the installation:

     t/DataPort/DataFile.t
     t/DataPort/FormDB.t

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    There are no known open issues.

4.0 NOTES
    The following are useful acronyms:

    .d  extension for a Perl demo script file

    .pm extension for a Perl Library Module

    .t  extension for a Perl test script file
